## Requirements
All the code was written with Python 3.8.1

To install requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
```

To run the service locally a mongo database needs to be set up for the logging and a DB_URI environment variable created. Once that is complete to run the app run the following from a termina/powershell from the app folder. 
```
python3 app.py
```
